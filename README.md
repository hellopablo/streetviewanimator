## How to Contribute

I welcome contirbutions to streetviewanimator. Fork the repo and submit a pull request. Please ensure that streetviewanimator.js compiles and that any relevant documentation is updated before sending the pull request.

### Compiling LESS and JS

I use Grunt to compile everything. Firstly, install `grunt-cli` globally. It's recommended to run the grunt client on a per-project basis, so if you have it installed globally, remove it.

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Install the dev dependancies

    npm install

Calling `grunt` in the project root will start the watcher causing changes to the JS to be compiled automatically.

    grunt
